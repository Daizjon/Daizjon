- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Daizjon
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in all sorts of things, from Software to Hardware! Programming languages I'm fluent in include; C, C++, Python, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, VHDL, Verilog, R, Assembly, and Matlab 
- I've also worked on projects dealing with; FPGAs, Microcontrollers, Circuit Design, CAD Design, Signal Processing, Embedded Systems, Web Design & Development, Linux, and more.
- Feel free to browse my folders and check out my work! For ease of access, my repositories will be labeled the topic they involve such as "C programs" then will have multiple folders within the repository for the multiple programs. I'm currently uploading old projects as well as working on new ones, so feel free to check back in for new updates!
